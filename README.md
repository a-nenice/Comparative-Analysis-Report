# Comparative-Analysis-Report
Visualization of year by year comparison of product sales.



I have used dummy financial data(also attached) to create a user interactive data dashboard on Microsoft Power BI. 




You can use this as an example or reuse it as an template to create your own report.

The dashboard is interactive, whatever data point you choose, the other data chart changes accordingly.
